# Feature Specification: LLM API Gateway

**Feature Branch**: `001-llm-api`
**Created**: 2024-09-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "LLM API Í≤åÏù¥Ìä∏Ïõ®Ïù¥"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:

- User types and permissions
- Data retention/deletion policies
- Performance targets and scale
- Error handling behaviors
- Integration requirements
- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A developer wants to use various LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) in their applications while tracking usage costs and maintaining control over API access. They deploy the LLM API Gateway on their own infrastructure and configure it with their real LLM API keys. The gateway issues virtual API keys that they distribute to their projects. Each project makes LLM API calls using these virtual keys, and the gateway proxies these requests to the actual LLM endpoints while tracking usage statistics per project.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a deployed LLM API Gateway with configured real API keys, **When** an administrator creates a virtual key for "Project A", **Then** the system generates a unique virtual API key that maps to the real keys
2. **Given** a virtual API key for "Project A", **When** the project makes an LLM API call using this virtual key, **Then** the gateway forwards the request to the real LLM endpoint and logs the usage
3. **Given** multiple projects using different virtual keys, **When** an administrator requests usage statistics, **Then** the system provides usage data segmented by project
4. **Given** a virtual key that has been revoked, **When** a project attempts to use it, **Then** the gateway rejects the request with an authentication error

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the real LLM API key is invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle virtual key management when multiple administrators are involved?
- What happens when the LLM endpoint is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from the underlying LLM providers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST proxy LLM API requests from clients to actual LLM endpoints
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate requests using virtual API keys separate from real LLM API keys
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain a mapping between virtual keys and real LLM API keys
- **FR-004**: System MUST track usage statistics (request count, token count, costs) per virtual key
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **FR-006**: Administrators MUST be able to create, list, and revoke virtual API keys
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide usage statistics grouped by virtual key/project
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle errors from LLM endpoints gracefully and return appropriate responses
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist virtual key configurations and usage data across restarts
- **FR-010**: System MUST be self-hostable with minimal external dependencies

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Virtual API Key**: A unique identifier issued per project, maps to real LLM API keys, has creation date and optional expiration
- **Real API Key**: The actual API credentials for LLM providers, stored securely and mapped to virtual keys
- **Usage Record**: Tracks individual API calls including timestamp, virtual key used, LLM provider, request/response token counts, and estimated cost
- **Project**: A logical grouping represented by a virtual API key for usage tracking and management
